# Today I Learned...

...that the house robot, Dead Metal, from Robot Wars...is female.

It's official! Despite being around for around 20 years, Dead Metal's gender is now official, and uses female pronouns. The gender of Dead Metal has been left ambiguous since its creation (yet mostly had 'he' pronouns for the lack thereof) but it's an interesting change.

Plus, when you take into account she looks like a predatory insect, you will find in the insect kingdom that the females can be more dangerous than their male counterparts, so I think it's quite fitting for the robot.
