# Today I Learned...

...to do sketches and make them into shapes in AutoDesk Fusion 360!

I'm currently working on something with LEDs, so I had to design an enclosure. Using Fusion 360 gives me a general idea of the shape and idea I'm going for.

Fusion 360 is free for hobbyists, and it's helpful for those getting into 3D modelling and design.

The resources I used for learning around Fusion 360 can be found (here)[http://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/]. It gets you from zero to hero in no time!
