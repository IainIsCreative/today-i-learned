# Today I Learned...

Oh hey! I didn't see you come in there, have a cup of tea. ☕️

Here is a repository full of files with things I learned on specific days. I don't always keep a note of these, so I figured it would be fun to not only put down some random facts, but also update it with resources too.

It's also a way of keeping track and not forgetting things I do learn. It should also give you a glimpse into my thinking and such.

How about making a repo of your own? Here's the architecture I'm using:

```
  today-i-learned
    |--README.md
    |--Year
        |--Month
            |--Day
```
